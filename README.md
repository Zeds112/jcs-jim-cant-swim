JCS Jim Can't Swim Episode Logger

I've found it difficult to find a (comprehensive) list of all JCS titles/episodes from Youtube and Patreon so thought I'd create one.
Please don't add any non-official links as I don't want this to get taken down.

Please sign up to the JCS Patreon to access the Patreon content:

Notes:
- For filename purposes, '*' in titles have been replaced with '#'.
- `"` in titles have been replaced with `'`.
- Some Youtube and Patreon episodes have multiple different titles. These have been grouped together
- runtime format is hh:mm:ss
- releaseDate format is yyyy-mm-dd
- Episodes are sorted oldest to newest
- The Wistia links have been hashed (SHA256) so are unusable but can still be tracked. Please access the real links through Patreon.

PRs to ./data/episodes.json welcome
